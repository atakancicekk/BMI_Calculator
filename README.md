#  BMI Calculator

The goal of this project is to learn more about Optionals, solidify your understanding of the MVC design pattern and to introduce the concept of Classes. I compared objects created from classes with instances of Structs that we learnt about earlier. 

## What I've built

With this project, I built a Body Mass Index calculator. Based on the userâ€™s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice depending on whether if they have eaten too many pies or if they need to eat more pies.
